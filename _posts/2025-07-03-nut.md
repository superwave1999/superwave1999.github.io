# Prologue

So as I may or may not have mentioned, I have an Eaton Ellipse ECO UPS plugged via USB into my server. The configuration was sadly lost with the old system, so it's the perfect time to recreate it!

Note: This guide may not be fully up-to-date. You can find a copy of my configs here.

## Network UPS Tools

The software highlight of this setup is [Network UPS Tools](https://networkupstools.org/) (NUT for short). This software works with many UPSes, can be configured to work with multiple machines at once over the network, and can power off the devices in multiple ways.

### Installation

As simple as:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nut
```

### Configuration

#### Configuration directory overview

```bash
ls -la /etc/nut
```

```text
drwxr-xr-x   2 root nut    7 Jul  1 22:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 100 root root 189 Jul 15 23:31 ..
-rw-r-----   1 root nut   16 Jul  1 22:15 nut.conf
-rw-r-----   1 root nut  110 Jul  1 22:16 ups.conf
-rw-r-----   1 root nut   20 Jul  1 22:17 upsd.conf
-rw-r-----   1 root nut   88 Jul  1 22:18 upsd.users
-rw-r-----   1 root nut  241 Jul  1 22:19 upsmon.conf
```

Let's go through each file one-by-one.

#### nut.conf

This file should contain a single-line that indicates we're running a wired single UPS single server setup.

```text
MODE=standalone
```

#### ups.conf

This file describes the UPS you're running. Your UPS may vary. See the [compatibility list](https://networkupstools.org/stable-hcl.html).

```text
maxretry = 3
[eaton]
    driver = "usbhid-ups"
    port = "auto"
    vendorid = "0463"
    productid = "FFFF"
```

#### upsd.conf

This file configures upsd to listen on a given IP address and port. Usually You'd use 127.0.0.1, but I'm using 0.0.0.0 for monitoring purposes. I've (obviously) kept this port behind a firewall.

```text
LISTEN 0.0.0.0 3493
```

#### upsd.users

This is a file with login information for consumers of UPS information and status. You will probably only need one entry, but I have an extra "monitor" entry in use by a Docker container.

```text
[admin]
  password = admin
  admin master
[monitor]
  password = monitor
  upsmon slave
```

#### upsmon.conf

This is the most important configuration file. This tells the system how to act depending on the state of the UPS.

```text
MINSUPPLIES 1
SHUTDOWNCMD "/sbin/shutdown -h +0"
POLLFREQ 5
POLLFREQALERT 5
HOSTSYNC 15
DEADTIME 15
POWERDOWNFLAG /etc/killpower
RBWARNTIME 1200
NOCOMMWARNTIME 300
FINALDELAY 5

RUN_AS_USER root
MONITOR eaton@localhost 1 admin admin master
```

Explanation of each directive:

`MINSUPPLIES 1`

The minimum number of UPSes that must be up (online) before the system continues running.
Here, it means if at least 1 UPS is reachable and OK, don't shut down.

`SHUTDOWNCMD "/sbin/shutdown -h +0"`

The command to run when NUT decides the system must shut down (e.g., on low battery).
Here, it calls the system shutdown immediately (+0 means no delay).

`POLLFREQ 5`
How often (in seconds) upsmon polls the UPS status when everything is normal (no alerts).

`POLLFREQALERT 5`
How often (in seconds) upsmon polls the UPS during an alert condition (e.g., on battery).

`HOSTSYNC 15`
Interval in seconds at which upsmon syncs the system time with the UPS (if UPS supports time sync).

`DEADTIME 15`
Time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the UPS before considering the UPS unreachable.

`POWERDOWNFLAG /etc/killpower`
Path to a file that will be created by upsmon to signal that the system is going down and the UPS can cut power.

`RBWARNTIME 1200`
Time in seconds (20 minutes) before the battery runtime estimate becomes critical and triggers warnings.

`NOCOMMWARNTIME 300`
Time in seconds (5 minutes here) to wait after loss of communication with UPS before warning.

`FINALDELAY 5`
Delay in seconds between executing the shutdown command and creating the powerdown flag.

`RUN_AS_USER root`
Run the upsmon daemon as the root user (needed for shutdown commands and access to system functions).

`MONITOR eaton@localhost 1 admin admin master`
Defines the UPS to monitor. Here, "eaton" corresponds to the device entry in ups.conf. "localhost" is the server IP. "1" is the number of systems the UPS monitors. "admin" is the user entry in upsmon.users. The second "admin" is the password for that user in upsmon.users. "master" means this system is the master controller.

# Epilogue

You may have noticed one important caveat of NUT. It can't shut down the system based on the percentage of battery left. We can only configure a runtime once on battery `RBWARNTIME`. Just hope you have a battery in decent shape! We'll fix this issue in a future article.
